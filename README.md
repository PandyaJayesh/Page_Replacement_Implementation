# Page Replacement Algorithms Project

## Overview

This project implements and evaluates various page replacement algorithms used in operating systems, including Least Recently Used (LRU), First In First Out (FIFO), and Optimal (OPT). The goal is to simulate the page replacement process and compare the performance of these algorithms based on the number of page faults.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: This algorithm replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.
2. **FIFO (First In First Out)**: Pages are replaced in the order they were loaded into memory, with the first loaded page being replaced first.
3. **OPT (Optimal)**: The optimal algorithm replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future.

## Components

- `vmgen`: Generates a random page reference string used by the page replacement algorithms.
- `vmsim`: Simulates the page replacement algorithms (LRU, FIFO, OPT).
- `vmstats`: Provides statistical information on the page replacement process.

## Files

- `Makefile`: Build automation script for compiling and running the project.
- `vmgen.c++`: Source code for generating a random page reference string.
- `vmsim.c++`: Source code for simulating page replacement algorithms.
- `vmstats.c++`: Source code for gathering statistics on the simulation.
- `vmref.dat`: A file generated by `vmgen` that contains the page reference string.
- `vmrates.dat`: A file containing performance metrics.

## Usage

### Step 1: Compile the project

To compile the project, simply run:

    make


This will compile the `vmgen`, `vmsim`, and `vmstats` programs.

### Step 2: Generate the page reference string

To generate the page reference string, run:


    ./vmgen <number_of_pages> <number_of_references> <output_file>

For example:

    ./vmgen 40 100 vmref.dat


This will generate a page reference string with 40 pages and 100 references, saving the result to `vmref.dat`.

### Step 3: Run the page replacement simulations

To simulate the page replacement algorithms, run:

- For **LRU**:
    ```bash
    ./vmsim <number_of_frames> <page_reference_file> lru
- For **FIFO**:
    ```bash
    ./vmsim <number_of_frames> <page_reference_file> fifo
- For **OPT**:
    ```bash
    ./vmsim <number_of_frames> <page_reference_file> opt
For example:

    ./vmsim 3 vmref.dat lru
This will run the LRU page replacement algorithm with 3 frames using the page reference string from `vmref.dat`.

### Step 4: View the simulation statistics

To view the simulation statistics, run:

    ```bash
    ./vmstats <number_of_frames> <page_references> <time_window> <page_reference_file>
For example:

    ./vmstats 5 40 5 vmref.dat


This will display the page fault statistics for 5 frames and 40 page references.

## Clean Up

To clean up the generated files and executables, run:

    make clean
This will remove the compiled executables (`vmgen`, `vmsim`, `vmstats`) and data files (`vmref.dat`, `vmrates.dat`).
